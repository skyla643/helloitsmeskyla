# Hello, Human!

## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Skyla, the CEO of Emerald. It's a pleasure to virtually meet you!

ðŸ”’ As a computer science and cybersecurity major, I've been fascinated by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and its implications for security. Growing up, computers were and are my friends. My journey in this field has led me to establish Emerald with a vision to safeguard businesses and individuals against digital threats. Not only that, but I plan to expand my company to help kids like me and offer services to people in complex situations, helping them find safety. I know how it may feel to live in a system with solutions not fit for me.

## About Emerald

ðŸ’¼ Emerald is a cybersecurity company dedicated to providing top-notch security solutions tailored to the unique needs of our clients. We believe in proactive defensive strategies that empower organizations and individuals to stay ahead in the face of cyber threats.

ðŸš€ We're excited to announce that Emerald Cybersecurity Solutions will be launching this summer! Stay tuned for updates as we prepare to embark on this journey to enhance digital security for all. Please note that this is a soft launch. I plan to grow Emerald through trial and tribulation. With experience, I believe I can build a company fit for complex issues and offer realistic solutions.

## Feedback

The services on my website are also pinned on my GitHub. Please use them and provide feedback. I stuck to Python because it has a rich array of library add-ons that allow users to only need a terminal and won't need to download anything on their device.
